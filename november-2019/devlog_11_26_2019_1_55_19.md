### Dev Log

*created: 2019-11-26 01:55:19*

#### Notes
Did not develop much the past few days since I was caught up dealing with other real world stuff. I'm now still dealing with distractions from the enemy but I am working on returning to my mission of being as productive as possible. Ill be adopting a "working out in the open" philosophy, starting today. Open work means dev journals, open source code, code golf, and eventually streaming.



**TODOs**

- make template more flexible for devlog
- figure out how tagging will work
- add a makefile or mage or something to automate common commands
